Hi!  My name is KD Puvvadi but most people call me "KD" or "RK" depending up on how people know me. I'm currently as Sr. Site reliability Enginneer and residing in Hyderabad, India. People are more familiar with `Windows` more than `Linux`. Even the devs who write code for linux systems lacks basic understandings and only know what they need to know. i wanted to change that and educate people. That's why i'm lauching this `Back2Basics`. it is currently running under `basics` subdomain on my main domain `puvvadi.me`. it might move to new home (or not) in the future.  

If you see something that needs to be fixed, this documentation is open source!  Feel free to open an issue or PR [here](https://github.com/kdpuvvadi/back2basics/).
